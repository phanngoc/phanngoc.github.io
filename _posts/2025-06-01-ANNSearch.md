# Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search Tutorial

Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search is a method for finding data points in a dataset that are closest to a given query point, but with an acceptable margin of error to improve speed and efficiency. It is especially useful in high-dimensional spaces, where exact nearest neighbor searches can be computationally expensive.

## 1. Mathematical Background

Consider a dataset $X = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \}$ where each point $x_i$ is a vector in a $d$-dimensional space, $\mathbb{R}^d$. Given a query point $q$, the goal is to find the point $x_i \in X$ that minimizes the distance $\text{dist}(q, x_i)$. The most common distance metric used is the Euclidean distance:

$$
\text{dist}(q, x_i) = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^d (q_j - x_{ij})^2}
$$

where $q_j$ and $x_{ij}$ are the coordinates of the query point and the dataset point in the $j$-th dimension, respectively.

In ANN search, instead of finding the exact nearest neighbor, we find a point $x_k$ that is approximately the nearest, which reduces computation time, especially in large and high-dimensional datasets.

## 2. Example Data

Let's use a small 2D dataset for simplicity:

$$
X = \{ (1, 2), (4, 5), (7, 8), (9, 1) \}
$$

Query point:

$$
q = (6, 6)
$$

## 3. Exact Nearest Neighbor (for comparison)

To find the exact nearest neighbor, compute the Euclidean distance from $q$ to each point in $X$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{dist}(q, (1, 2)) &= \sqrt{(6 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 16} = \sqrt{41} \approx 6.4 \\
\text{dist}(q, (4, 5)) &= \sqrt{(6 - 4)^2 + (6 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.2 \\
\text{dist}(q, (7, 8)) &= \sqrt{(6 - 7)^2 + (6 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.2 \\
\text{dist}(q, (9, 1)) &= \sqrt{(6 - 9)^2 + (6 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 25} = \sqrt{34} \approx 5.8 \\
\end{align*}
$$

The exact nearest neighbors are $(4, 5)$ and $(7, 8)$.

## 4. Approximate Nearest Neighbor

In ANN, we aim to quickly find a point that is likely close enough to $q$ without calculating the exact distance to every point. Some techniques include:

- **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: It hashes points into the same bucket if they are close in distance.
- **KD-Trees**: It partitions the space into regions, reducing the number of points checked.
- **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: It uses a graph structure to navigate quickly through points.

### Using KD-Tree (Example)

1. Construct a KD-tree based on $X$.
2. Search for the nearest point to $q$ by navigating through the tree.

Assuming the tree is structured to quickly rule out regions of space far from $q$, we might quickly find that $(7, 8)$ is close enough without calculating the distances for all points. This process would save computation time, especially if $X$ were much larger.

## 5. Accuracy vs. Speed Trade-off

ANN offers a trade-off:

- **Accuracy**: It might not always return the exact nearest neighbor but one close enough, usually within a defined ratio (e.g., 1.2 times the distance of the exact neighbor).
- **Speed**: The time complexity is reduced from $O(n)$ in the exact search to $O(\log n)$ or even constant time with efficient structures like LSH.

## Summary

- **Exact Nearest Neighbor**: Guaranteed to find the closest point, but slower.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor**: Faster, with a trade-off in accuracy.

ANN is crucial in high-dimensional and large-scale data scenarios like image retrieval, recommendation systems, and clustering algorithms where speed is a priority.
