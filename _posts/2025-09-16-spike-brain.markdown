## Introduction

In the era of rapidly developing AI, creating efficient and energy-saving large language models has become a major challenge. **SpikingBrain** emerges as a breakthrough solution, inspired by brain mechanisms to create AI models that are both powerful and resource-efficient.

## Why SpikingBrain?

### Current Problems
- **Massive computational costs**: Large models like GPT-4 require millions of USD for training
- **High energy consumption**: A single inference can consume significant energy
- **NVIDIA hardware dependency**: Limits scalability and increases costs

### SpikingBrain Solutions
- **100x higher performance**: First token generation time is 100x faster
- **69% computation savings**: Only 31% of neurons are active at any given time
- **Training with less data**: Requires <2% data compared to traditional models
- **Multi-platform compatibility**: Runs well on both NVIDIA and non-NVIDIA clusters

## How SpikingBrain Works

### 1. Brain-Inspired Mechanisms

#### Event-driven Processing
Instead of continuous processing like traditional models, SpikingBrain only activates when there's input signal, similar to neurons in the human brain:

```
Neurons only "fire" when reaching stimulation threshold
→ Significant energy savings
→ Increased processing speed
```

#### Modular Architecture
- Divide the model into specialized modules
- Each module handles a specific type of task
- Only activate necessary modules → Reduce computational costs

#### Adaptive Memory
- Use intelligent information compression mechanisms
- Update state according to Markov chain
- Optimize data storage and retrieval

### 2. Model Architecture

#### Spike Encoding
- Convert data into binary spike sequences (0/1)
- Use integers instead of floating-point numbers → Save memory and energy
- Only compute when spikes occur → Reduce FLOPs

#### Hybrid Linear Models
- Combine two processing pathways:
  - **Spike path**: Simple processing, energy-efficient
  - **Integer path**: Precise processing for complex tasks
- Automatically select appropriate pathway

#### Mixture of Experts (MoE)
- Divide network into multiple "experts"
- Only activate 2-4 experts per token
- Reduce cost from O(M) to O(k) where k << M

#### Efficient Attention
- Instead of considering all tokens, only consider ~32K most important tokens
- Reduce complexity from O(n²) to O(n×m) where m << n
- Particularly efficient with long context (4M+ tokens)

## Impressive Results

### Computational Performance
- **Sparsity > 69%**: More than 69% of neurons in "rest" state
- **Speedup > 100x**: 100x faster for TTFT (Time To First Token)
- **Memory efficient**: 125x reduction in attention cost

### Training Efficiency
- **< 2% data resource**: Requires less than 2% data compared to traditional models
- **Conversion-based training**: Can convert from existing Transformer models
- **Train from scratch**: New training with high efficiency

### Hardware Compatibility
- **Non-NVIDIA support**: Optimized for MetaX and other clusters
- **CUDA/Triton kernels**: Full support for optimized operators
- **Neuromorphic chips**: Towards specialized hardware

## Core Mathematical Formula

To better understand SpikingBrain's efficiency, we have the general formula:

$$R = \alpha \times \frac{m}{n} + (1-\alpha) \times a \times \frac{k}{M}$$

Where:
- $\alpha$: Attention cost ratio compared to total
- $\frac{m}{n}$: Attention reduction ratio ($m \ll n$)
- $a$: Active neuron ratio ($a = 1 - \text{sparsity}$)
- $\frac{k}{M}$: Activated experts ratio

**Real example:**
- $n = 4M$ tokens, $m = 32K$ → $\frac{m}{n} \approx 0.008$
- Sparsity = 69% → $a = 0.31$
- $M = 64$ experts, $k = 2$ → $\frac{k}{M} = 0.031$
- $\alpha = 0.8$

→ **Speedup ≈ 120x** compared to traditional dense models!

## Technical Details

### Event-driven Processing Mechanism

The LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) model is used to simulate neuron activity:

$$v_{t+1} = \lambda v_t + w^T x_t - \theta_t$$

$$s_t = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } v_{t+1} > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where:
- $v_t$: Membrane potential at time $t$
- $\lambda$: Leak factor
- $\theta_t$: Adaptive threshold
- $s_t$: Spike signal (0 or 1)

**Benefits**: Only compute when spikes occur → Reduce 3.2x FLOPs compared to dense models.

### MoE (Mixture of Experts) Architecture

**FFN cost formula:**
$$\text{FLOPs}_{\text{MoE}} \approx \frac{k}{M} \times \text{FLOPs}_{\text{dense}}$$

With spiking activity:
$$\text{FLOPs}_{\text{effective}} \approx a \times \frac{k}{M} \times \text{FLOPs}_{\text{dense}}$$

**Real example:**
- $M = 64$ experts, $k = 2$, $a = 0.31$
- → Reduce 103x FFN cost compared to dense model

### Efficient Attention Mechanism

**Attention reduction formula:**
$$\text{FLOPs}_{\text{attention}} \approx O(n \times m \times d_k) \text{ instead of } O(n^2 \times d_k)$$

**Reduction ratio:**
$$r_{\text{attention}} = \frac{m}{n}$$

**Example with long context:**
- $n = 4M$ tokens, $m = 32K$ tokens
- → Reduce 125x attention cost

### Energy Efficiency Metrics

| Model | Active Neurons | Energy Reduction | Speedup |
|-------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Traditional | 100% | 0% | 1x |
| SpikingBrain-7B | 31% | 69% | 100x |
| SpikingBrain-76B | 15% | 85% | 120x |

## General Formula

**Overall model cost ratio:**
$$R = \alpha \times \frac{m}{n} + (1-\alpha) \times a \times \frac{k}{M}$$
